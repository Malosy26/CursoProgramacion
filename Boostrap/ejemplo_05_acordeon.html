                        collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
                        control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can
                        modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It’s also worth noting
                        that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition
                        does limit overflow.
